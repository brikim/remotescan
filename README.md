# Remotescan
Remotescan replaces the default Plex, Emby and Jellyfin scan my library automatically function. The Remotescan docker container should be run on the PC where your media is stored. It will then be configured to notify your media server of any changes(New, Modify and Delete)
> [!NOTE]
> üìù The scan for new media function of your media server will not work over network shares(NFS or SAMBA).

Uses iNotify to process file changes and notify Plex, Emby and/or Jellyfin.

Remotescan uses python to monitor defined folders, add new folders to monitor and remove deleted folders from monitor. Once a change is detected monitors will wait for a defined time before requesting the media server to scan for changes. This is done so that multiple new files being added do not flood the media server with scan requests.

## Installing Remotescan
Remotescan offers a pre-compiled [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/brikim/remotescan/general)

### Usage
Use docker compose to run Remotescan

### compose.yml
```yaml
---
services:
  remotescan:
    container_name: remotescan
    image: brikim/remotescan:latest
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    environment:
      - TZ=Etc/UTC
    volumes:
      - /docker/remotescan/config:/config:ro
      - /docker/remotescan/logs:/logs
      - /pathToMedia:/media
    restart: unless-stopped
```
> [!NOTE]
> üìù /media folder can not be read only for the docker container to shut down nicely
